7. Indeed, "generator" programming is more like "Concurrent Programming",
   than "Functional Programming in his chapter ".

    - "Scalar" language provides "stream" type and using this,
      It's possible for "generator" to act in way of "Declarative Programming".

    - Whereas, TypeScript don't provide "stream" type.
      Thus, "generator" could act only in way of "Imperative Programming in TypeScript ".   <--- ***

    - In TypeScript, "generator" is *NOT* in the section of "Functional Programming".       <--- ***
      But Like 08-5, "generator" could be created in way of "Functional Programming".       <--- ***
