******************************************
* 08-1. What is Functional Programming ? *
******************************************

0. Background

(1) "Functional Programming" is the code design & implementation technique
    using
        ① "Function Composition"
        ② "Monadic Composition"
    on the foundation of
        ③ "Pure Function"
        ④ "Declarative Programming".                                                                <--- ***

(2) In this chapter shows "TypeScript Functional Programming".

(3) "Functional Programming" is based on the following three mathematical theores:
    ① Lambda calculus   : Logical Mathematics
                           on the foundation of "Matrix Logic" & "Category Theory".
    ② Combinatory logic : The logical background of "Function Composition".                         <--- ***
    ③ Category Theory   : The logical background of "Monadic Composition" and "High-order Type"     <--- ***

(4) "Functional" programming languages is based on
        ① "Static Type"
        ② "Automatic Memory Management"
        ③ "Evaluation"
        ④ "Type Inference"
        ⑤ "First-class Function"
    and provides High-level features of
        ① "Algebraic Data Type"
        ② "Pattern Matching"
        ③ "Monad"
        ④ "High-order Type"
        and so on.                                                                                  <--- ***

    - But Funtional programming launguage don't provide all above features.

(5) "Functional" programming language is based on "LISP" called "AI language" once.
    - "LISP" evolved to the "Meta" Language and the "Meta" Language again evolved to the "Haskell".
    - "Haskell" have developer-friendly statements like C language due to the influence of "Scalar".
    - "TypeScript" evolves "Scalar" language statements to more "JavaScript"-friendly.              <--- ***
    - From this perspective, "TypeScript" in deed is the easiest "Functional Programming Language". <--- ***

    * In summary, LISP > META > Haskell.

(6) "TypeScript" abbreviates the features of
        ① "Pattern Matching"
        ② "High-Order Types".
    considered very important in the "Functional Programming Languages".                            <--- ***

    - Because of this, "Statements" are made more easier.   (***)

    - In deed, The reason of making "Haskell" or "Scalar" statements very difficulty is that
      the statements related to the "Pattern Matching" & "High-Order Types" is very complicated.

    - For these reasons, These days popular "Kotlin" or "Swift" also have just "Pattern Matching",
      but "High-Order Types" statements *NOT* exists.
