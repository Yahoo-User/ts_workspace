* 05-2. Declarative Programming and Array       *
*************************************************

0. Background

(1) "Functional Programming" has deep relation with "Declarative Programming".  <--- ***

(2) "Array" is required to implement "Declarative Programming".                 <--- ***

(3) "Imperative Programming" couldn't compares equally to the "Declarative Programming".
    - "Imperative" programming is more CPU-friendly low-level implementation style.
    - "Declarative" programming is more Human-friendly high-level implementation style
      over the "Imperative Programming".    (***)

(4) Relationship-diagram
    between "Functional", "Declarative", "Imperative" programming styles:

    ( Function ( Declarative ) )  ( Imperative )
